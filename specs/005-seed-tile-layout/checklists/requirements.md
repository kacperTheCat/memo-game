# Specification Quality Checklist: Deterministic game seed (Briefcase)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation summary

| Item | Result |
|------|--------|
| Content Quality | Pass — constitution block references end-to-end and unit tests for **coverage planning**; requirements avoid runtime stack. |
| FR-007 | Pass — states verifiability and points to user-story e2e paths + repo unit-test standards without mandating a runtime stack. |
| Success Criteria | Pass — SC-001/002 describe reproducibility and input format without naming algorithms or storage. |

## Notes

- Ready for **`/speckit.plan`** or **`/speckit.clarify`** if stakeholders want to tighten copy for helper text or “block start until complete seed” (currently **assumes** partial seed does not force deterministic dealing but **allows** start per User Story 2).
